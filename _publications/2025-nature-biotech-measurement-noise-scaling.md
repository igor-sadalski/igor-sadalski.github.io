excerpt: 'Unlike other domains where model performance scales predictably with dataset size, biological data performance is also limited by measurement noise from technical factors like molecular undersampling or imaging variability. By learning representations of single-cell genomic and imaging data, we show that noise defines a distinct scaling axis along which performance improves predictably across tasks. This scaling follows a simple logarithmic law that is consistent across model types, tasks, and datasets, and can be derived quantitatively from a model of noise propagation.'
