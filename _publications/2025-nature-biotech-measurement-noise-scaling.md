excerpt: 'Large genomic and imaging datasets can be used to fit models that learn representations of cellular systems, extracting informative structure from data. In other domains, model performance improves predictably with dataset size, providing a basis for allocating data and computation. In biological data, however, performance is also limited by measurement noise arising from technical factors such as molecular undersampling or imaging variability. By learning representations of single-cell genomic and imaging data, we show that noise defines a distinct axis along which performance improves predictably across tasks. This scaling follows a simple logarithmic law that is consistent across model types, tasks, and datasets, and can be derived quantitatively from a model of noise propagation. We identify robustness to noise and saturating performance as properties that vary across models and tasks.'
