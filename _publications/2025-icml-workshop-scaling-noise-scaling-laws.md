excerpt: 'Learning meaningful representations of cellular states is a key problem in computational biology. Yet, the scaling behavior of single-cell representation learning models remains poorly understood. While recent work has proposed that model performance scales predictably with measurement noise, this hypothesis has only been validated with relatively small models and datasets. We demonstrate that previously observed noise-scaling behavior again consistently emerges in these large-scale models and datasets. '
