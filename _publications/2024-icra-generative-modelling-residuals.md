title: "Generative Modelling of Residuals for Real-Time Risk-Sensitive Safety with Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2024-icra-generative-modelling-residuals
excerpt: 'A key source of brittleness for robotic systems is the presence of model uncertainty and external disturbances. This work proposes a training a state-conditioned generative model to represent the distribution of error residuals between the nominal dynamics and the actual system. We demonstrate our approach in simulations and hardware, and show that our method can learn a disturbance model that is accurate enough to enable risk-sensitive control of a quadrotor flying aggressively with an unmodelled slung load.'
