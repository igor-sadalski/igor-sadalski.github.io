## Work Experience

**Machine Learning Scientist**, Somite.ai (Boston, MA)  
*Sep. '24 – Present*

* Architected spot-instance, SLURM-based training infrastructure integrating FSDP, mixed precision, and Flash Attention across tens of MI325X/H200 GPUs, enabling **scalable, multi-node training of billion-parameter transformers** on proprietary data and establishing the first company-wide software stack at this scale.
* Led curation of genomic data scraped from the internet and engineered distributed data pipeline to process terabytes of data, achieving nearly 3x speedup compared to standard tools.
* Designed agentic AI pipelines to automate data curation and new agentic approaches for advancing cell annotation.
* Investigated scaling laws for transformer and VAE-based models on genomic data and benchmarked encoding strategies, generating insights leading to work **presented at ICML Workshop '25** and **submitted to Nature Biotechnology**.
* Joined as the 6th employee at a Harvard-MIT academic spinoff developing foundation models for the human cell ($60M+ in funding).

## Research Experience

**Research Assistant**, Harvard University (PI: Prof. Stephanie Gil)  
*Apr. '24 – Sep. '24*

* Investigated techniques for performing sub-quadratic attention; based on this work, I designed a long-context time series transformer-based model. The model was later used to proactively route shuttle buses around Harvard campus.

**Research Assistant**, Caltech (PI: Prof. Aaron Ames)  
*Jun. '23 – Aug. '23*

* Designed conditional variational autoencoders and diffusion models to obtain data-driven error estimates from flight data. These models were later used to improve drone flight performance and safety.

**Research Assistant**, Caltech (PI: Prof. Aaron Ames)  
*Jun. '22 – Aug. '22*

* Sped up model predictive controller running on robotic hardware by rewriting matrix operations using optimized C++ library.

## Education

**MSc Computer Science (Machine Learning)**, Imperial College London  
*Sep. '23 – Sep. '24*

*Selected Coursework*: Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Graph-Based Learning, Software Engineering for ML Systems, Natural Language Processing.  
*Thesis*: Generative Modeling with Efficient Transformers for Pro-Active Bus Routing.

**BEng Mechanical Engineering (Robotics)**, Imperial College London  
*Oct. '20 – Jun. '23*
