## Work Experience

**Machine Learning Scientist**, Somite.ai (Boston, MA)  
*Sep. '24 – Present*

* Orchestrated large-scale distributed training and published papers working on multimodal foundational models for life sciences.

## Research Experience

**Research Assistant**, Harvard University (PI: Prof. Stephanie Gil)  
*Apr. '24 – Sep. '24*

* Investigated techniques for performing sub-quadratic attention; based on this work, I designed a long-context time series transformer-based model. The model was later used to proactively route shuttle buses around Harvard campus.

**Research Assistant**, Caltech (PI: Prof. Aaron Ames)  
*Jun. '23 – Aug. '23*

* Designed conditional variational autoencoders and diffusion models to obtain data-driven error estimates from flight data. These models were later used to improve drone flight performance and safety.

**Research Assistant**, Caltech (PI: Prof. Aaron Ames)  
*Jun. '22 – Aug. '22*

* Sped up model predictive controller running on robotic hardware by rewriting matrix operations using optimized C++ library.

## Education

**MSc Computer Science (Machine Learning)**, Imperial College London  
*Sep. '23 – Sep. '24*

*Selected Coursework*: Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Graph-Based Learning, Software Engineering for ML Systems, Natural Language Processing.  
*Thesis*: Generative Modeling with Efficient Transformers for Pro-Active Bus Routing.

**BEng Mechanical Engineering (Robotics)**, Imperial College London  
*Oct. '20 – Jun. '23*

## Open Source Contributions

**Stanford Biomni - General-Purpose Biomedical AI Agent** - *Autumn '25*  
Main contribution: Implemented state-of-the-art foundational models (ESM-2, Transformer, scGPT, STATE) with standardized interfaces.

**Various projects at MIT Hackers Club (Sundai.ai)** - *Autumn '24*  
Created a multiplayer LLM-powered game using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Convex, and Vercel.
