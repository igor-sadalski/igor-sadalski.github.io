I'm a Machine Learning Scientist at [Somite.ai](https://somite.ai), a Harvard-MIT academic spinoff developing foundation models for the human cell. I work on scaling transformer architectures for genomic data, distributed training infrastructure, and agentic AI pipelines for biological discovery.

I hold an MSc in Computer Science (Machine Learning) from Imperial College London and a BEng in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics). My research interests include foundational models for genomics, efficient transformer architectures, distributed training systems, and agentic AI for scientific discovery.

I've previously conducted research at Harvard University (with Prof. Stephanie Gil) and Caltech (with Prof. Aaron Ames), working on efficient attention mechanisms, generative models for robotics, and model predictive control.
