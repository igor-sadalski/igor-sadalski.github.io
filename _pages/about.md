I'm a Machine Learning Scientist at [Somite.ai](https://somite.ai), a Harvard-MIT academic spinoff developing foundation models for the human cell. I work on scaling transformer architectures for genomic data, designing distributed training infrastructure, and building agentic AI pipelines for biological discovery.

I hold an MSc in Computer Science (Machine Learning) from Imperial College London, where my thesis focused on "Generative Modeling with Efficient Transformers for Pro-Active Bus Routing." I also completed a BEng in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics) at Imperial.

My research interests include:
- Foundational models for genomics and single-cell biology
- Efficient transformer architectures and scaling laws
- Distributed training systems and infrastructure
- Agentic AI for scientific discovery

I've previously conducted research at Harvard University (with Prof. Stephanie Gil) and Caltech (with Prof. Aaron Ames), working on efficient attention mechanisms, generative models for robotics, and model predictive control.

I'm passionate about open source and have contributed to projects like Stanford Biomni, implementing state-of-the-art foundational models for biomedical AI.
