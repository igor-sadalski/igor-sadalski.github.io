I'm a Machine Learning Scientist at [Somite.ai](https://somite.ai), a Harvard-MIT academic spinoff developing foundation models for the human cell. My past and current project included: orchestrating distributed training, developing transformer and diffusion models for representation learning and perturbation prediction, deploying agentic AI pipelines for streaminling biological discovery by our scientists.

I hold an Master of Science with Distinction in Computer Science (specialization of Machine Learning) from Imperial College London. I've previously conducted research at Harvard University (with [Prof. Stephanie Gil](https://seas.harvard.edu/person/stephanie-gil)) working on subquadratic attention mechanisms and at Caltech (with [Prof. Aaron Ames](http://ames.caltech.edu/)) working on VAEs and diffusion models. 

In was also select as a Fulbright scholar from Poland (which I declined to work at Somite). In 2020 I was a top student in Poland achieving maximal marks in marticulation exams.

In free time I like to cook and play board games with my friends.
