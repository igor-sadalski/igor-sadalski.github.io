I'm a Machine Learning Scientist at [Somite.ai](https://somite.ai), a Harvard-MIT academic spinoff developing foundation models for the human cell. I work on distributed training infrastructure, core representation learning for transcriptomic data, and agentic AI pipelines for biological discovery.

I hold an MSc in Computer Science (Machine Learning) from Imperial College London. I've previously conducted research at Harvard University (with Prof. Stephanie Gil) and Caltech (with Prof. Aaron Ames). I was also a Fulbright scholar.
